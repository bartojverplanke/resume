## Bart Verplanke

## Background
I'm currently studying the master Behavioural Data Science at the University of Amsterdam. Before I did the bachelor Beta-Gamma, an interdisciplinairy bachelor where I focused on psychology, statistics and programming. Besides my studies I teached first year students the fundamentals of Python, I co-hosted a science radio podcast called Radio Swammerdam, and did some volunteering within and outside of the University.

I'm proficient in using R and Python. I like working on projects that are related to human behaviour and ideally to improve wellbeing of humans, animals and the planet.

## Projects
### Big Data Analytics Course
For the course Big Data Analytics I worked on 4 different Kaggle competitions with 4 different groups. 

[Competition 1: Personality profiling of Youtube vloggers](https://www.kaggle.com/code/bartverplanke/competition-1-round-2-group-15)
In this competition we tested different models that predict vloggers personality (Big Five) based on their video transcripts, audiovisual features, and gender. Our final model landed us in the top 5 of the competition.

[Competition 2: Recognizing physical activity](https://www.kaggle.com/code/bartverplanke/sensor-group-6)
In this competition our group had to recognize certain types of physical activity from gyroscopic and accelerator data. We extracted features from this data and tried different models to improve recognition. Our final model (LDA) had an accuracy of 86% on the test set.

[Competition 3: Amazon customor satisfaction](https://www.kaggle.com/code/bartverplanke/amazon-group11)
In this competition our task was to build a classifier that automatically recognize customer satisfaction from textual reviews of baby products that were sold on Amazon.com. Our final model (lasso regression) performed with 75% accuracy on the test set.

[Competition 4: Predicting facial expressions](https://www.kaggle.com/code/bartverplanke/team-4)
In this competion our group had to predict the emotion of facial expression of grayscaled images. To do this we extraced certain features from the images and trained different models. Our best model (a ridge regression) performed with 93% accuracy on the test set.
