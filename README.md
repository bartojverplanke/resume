### Big Data Analytics Course
For the course Big Data Analytics I worked on 4 different Kaggle competitions with 4 different groups. 

[Competition 4: Predicting facial expressions](https://www.kaggle.com/code/bartverplanke/team-4)
In this competion our group had to predict the emotion of facial expression of grayscaled images. To do this we extraced certain features from the images and trained different models. Our best model (a ridge regression) performed with 93% accuracy on the test set
